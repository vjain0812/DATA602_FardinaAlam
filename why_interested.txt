Why are you interested in taking DATA602?

Well, because this course provides foundation to all the Data Science and ML concepts that are required to learn and grow in the field of Machine Learning.
I aspire to be a Machine Learning Engineer/CTO in the distant future at a startup of my own and these fundamentals would carry me through this journey.
In the near future I see myself working at a mid-to-big sized company at an entry level ML role. These basics would enable me to land that role and grow as an engineer.
